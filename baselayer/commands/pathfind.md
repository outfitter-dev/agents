# Pathfinding

Adaptive Q&A workflow to clarify requirements and build confidence before delivering.

## How It Works

1. Assess clarity and set initial confidence (0–5)
2. Ask one question at a time using EnterPlanMode
3. Restate answer, update confidence, surface concerns
4. At level 5 (Ready), deliver the artifact
5. Below level 5, include `△ Caveats`

## When to Use

- Ambiguous or incomplete requirements
- Complex features needing exploration
- Greenfield projects with open questions
- Collaborative brainstorming or problem solving

## Initial Request

$ARGUMENTS

---

Load the pathfinding skill and begin. Assess clarity of the request — if clear (level 4–5), fast-track to delivery. If vague (level 0–2), start with foundational questions about scope, goals, or context.
