# Challenge Complexity

Evaluate the proposed solution for unnecessary complexity before committing to it.

## The Framework

1. IDENTIFY — what complexity is being proposed?
2. ALTERNATIVE — what's the simplest thing that could work?
3. QUESTION — why isn't the simple approach sufficient?
4. DOCUMENT — if complexity is justified, record why

## Red Flag Rationalizations

Watch for these justifications — they usually indicate unjustified complexity:

- "We might need this later"
- "It's more flexible this way"
- "This is how X company does it"
- "It's the industry standard"
- "We should do it right the first time"

## Proposal to Evaluate

$ARGUMENTS

---

Load the challenge-complexity skill and begin by:
1. Restating the proposed approach
2. Identifying the complexity being introduced
3. Proposing the simplest alternative that might work

The goal is NOT to reject all complexity — it's to ensure complexity is justified by evidence, not speculation.
