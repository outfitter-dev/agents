# Systematic Debugging

Start a methodical debugging session using the four-phase investigation framework.

## The Process

1. Root Cause Investigation — gather evidence, reproduce the issue, trace the failure
2. Pattern Analysis — compare working vs broken, identify what changed
3. Hypothesis Testing — test one variable at a time, validate assumptions
4. Implementation — write failing test first, then fix

## The Iron Law

NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST

If you catch yourself wanting to "just try something" — stop. Return to investigation.

## Problem to Debug

$ARGUMENTS

---

Load the debugging skill and begin by gathering evidence:
1. What is the exact error or unexpected behavior?
2. When did it start occurring?
3. What changed recently?
4. Can you reproduce it consistently?

Do NOT propose fixes until you understand the root cause.
