# Architecture Design

Design the system or feature using structured architectural thinking.

## The Process

1. **Requirements Analysis** - Functional needs, scale expectations, constraints
2. **Technology Selection** - Evaluate options against requirements with decision matrices
3. **System Design** - Components, data flow, integration points
4. **Tradeoff Analysis** - Document what you're optimizing for and what you're sacrificing
5. **ADR** - Record the decision with context, options considered, and rationale

## Core Principles

- **Proven over Novel** - Use boring technology unless novel solves a real problem
- **Complexity Budget** - Every abstraction has a cost; spend wisely
- **Evolutionary Architecture** - Design for change, not for prediction

## Design Task

$ARGUMENTS

---

Load the architect skill for the complete methodology, technology selection frameworks, and ADR templates.

Begin by:
1. Clarifying the functional and non-functional requirements
2. Identifying constraints (team size, timeline, existing systems)
3. Listing the key architectural decisions that need to be made

Do NOT jump to solutions before understanding requirements and constraints.
