# Challenge Complexity

Evaluate the proposed solution for unnecessary complexity before committing to it.

## The Framework

1. **IDENTIFY** - What complexity is being proposed?
2. **ALTERNATIVE** - What's the simplest thing that could work?
3. **QUESTION** - Why isn't the simple approach sufficient?
4. **DOCUMENT** - If complexity is justified, record why

## Red Flag Rationalizations

Watch for these justifications - they usually indicate unjustified complexity:

- "We might need this later"
- "It's more flexible this way"
- "This is how X company does it"
- "It's the industry standard"
- "We should do it right the first time"

## Quick Check

Before any implementation, ask:
1. What's the simplest version that solves the actual problem?
2. What concrete evidence requires more complexity?
3. Can we start simple and add complexity when proven necessary?

## Proposal to Evaluate

$ARGUMENTS

---

Load the challenge-complexity skill for the complete framework, common triggers, and simpler alternatives.

Begin by:
1. Restating the proposed approach
2. Identifying the complexity being introduced
3. Proposing the simplest alternative that might work

The goal is NOT to reject all complexity - it's to ensure complexity is justified by evidence, not speculation.
