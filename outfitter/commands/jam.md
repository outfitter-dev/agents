# Jam Session

Start an adaptive Q&A workflow to clarify requirements and build confidence before delivering solutions.

## How It Works

1. Ask exactly one question at a time with 2–4 meaningful options
2. Restate your answer and update **Confidence** (🚫🔴🟡🟢)
3. At 🟢 High (≥86), deliver the solution
4. If delivering below 🟢, include uncertainty notes

## When to Use

- Requirements are unclear or incomplete
- Exploring solution approaches
- Planning complex features
- Greenfield projects with open questions

## Initial Request

$ARGUMENTS

---

Begin by assessing the clarity of the request. If the topic is clear enough (🟡 or 🟢), start with your first targeted question. If unclear (🚫 or 🔴), ask foundational questions about scope, goals, or context.

Load the jam skill for detailed guidance on confidence intervals, question formatting, and the reflection step process.
