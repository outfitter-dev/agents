description: Implement a feature or fix using test-driven development (Red-Green-Refactor)
argument-hint: [feature or bug to implement]

# Test-Driven Development

Implement the requested feature using strict TDD methodology.

## The Cycle

```
RED → GREEN → REFACTOR (repeat)
```

1. **RED**: Write a failing test that defines the expected behavior
2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up while keeping tests green

## Rules

- Never write production code without a failing test first
- Each cycle should take 5-15 minutes
- Commit at each green state
- Tests are first-class code - no shortcuts

## Task to Implement

$ARGUMENTS

---

Load the test-driven-development skill for the complete methodology, language-specific patterns (TypeScript/Rust), and quality standards.

Begin by:
1. Clarifying the requirements (what behavior needs to be implemented?)
2. Identifying the first small, testable behavior
3. Writing the first failing test

Do NOT write implementation code before you have a failing test.
